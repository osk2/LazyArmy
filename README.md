# LazyArmy

LazyArmy aims to be an app that have ability to report automatically with nice-looking design, however it's been **DEPRECATED NOW**!

Since I can't figure out how to build [LINEAPI4J](https://github.com/cslinmiso/LineAPI4J) on Android and LINE require user to review login, this seems impossible to achieve.

Anyway, contributions are welcome!
